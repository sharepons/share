 * Robinhood Chain.

 * ⚠⚠ This chain makes a block roughly every 100ms and the public RPC caps `eth_getLogs` at 2,000
 * blocks — about three minutes of history. Nothing on this site reads a log for that reason. The
 * launch feed comes out of an array on `CharityLaunchpad`, read with `eth_call`, which is why there
 * is no indexer, no database and no backend to keep alive.
 *
 * ⚠ `rpc.robinhood.com` does NOT resolve. The working host is `rpc.mainnet.chain.robinhood.com`.

  ⚠⚠ READ DEFENSIVELY, never as `import.meta.env.VITE_RHC_RPC`.

  Vite defines `import.meta.env`, but any script that imports this module under plain Node, which is
  how the address checks and the launch helpers get tested, finds it UNDEFINED and a direct property
  read throws before a single line of the test runs. Testing the real module beats testing a copy of
  it, so the module has to survive being imported outside a bundler.
