/**
 * What one unit of a pair asset is worth in USD, read from Uniswap V4 on Robinhood Chain.
 *
 * ## ⛔⛔ WHY THE MARKET CAP IS IN DOLLARS AND NOT IN ETHER
 *
 * A cap shown as "1.68 ETH" is not a market cap, it is a reserve balance wearing one. Nobody reads
 * a token's size in ether, two tokens paired against different assets cannot be compared at a
 * glance, and the number moves when ETH moves even though nothing about the token changed. Pons's
 * own feed reports `marketCapUsd`, and this has been got wrong here before.
 *
 * ➤ So every cap on this site is converted to USD, and a cap that cannot be converted shows a dash
 * rather than a figure in whatever unit happened to be available.
 *
 * ## ⭐⭐ THE RATE COMES FROM THE CHAIN, NOT FROM AN API
 *
 * USDG is the dollar here. Reading the asset's USDG pool out of the V4 singleton's storage keeps
 * this site what it is: a static page that reads the chain in the visitor's browser, with no key,
 * no backend and no third party that can rate limit it or go down. It is the same derivation
 * `V4Seller.poolState` uses on chain, reproduced exactly.
 *
 * ## ⛔⛔ AN INITIALISED POOL IS NOT A LIQUID POOL
 *
 * Measured on live RHC: MSTR/USDG is initialised at `fee=100` holding ZERO liquidity, and GME/USDG
 * is initialised at `fee=3000` with nothing in it while trading at `fee=10000`. `sqrtPriceX96` is
 * non zero in all of those, so a reader that stops at "the pool exists" gets a confident price off
 * an empty book. Every tier is read and the DEEPEST one wins; if none holds liquidity the answer is
 * null.
